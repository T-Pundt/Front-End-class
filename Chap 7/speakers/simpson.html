          <h1>The Bio of Lisa Simpson</h1>
          <img src="../images/lisa_simpson.png" alt="Lisa Simpson" width="260" />
          <p>Lisa Simpson is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement level of children her age. 
            Not to everyone's surprise, she's also the moral center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental 
            involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies like playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, 
            and interest in advanced studies. </p>
          <p>In school, Lisa's popularity's affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a 
            few friends. Lisa Simpson's a smart, witty, independent girl who focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, 
            and at age 8 she's already a member of MENSA with an IQ of 159.</p>
          <p>Her musical abilities are extensive: she sings with a powerful voice, and was seen playing the acoustic six-string, 
            electric bass guitar, accordion and piano proficiently. Her greatest love's playing jazz on her baritone saxophone. Her 
            musical inclinations were nurtured by her relationship with the late jazz musician Bleeding Gums Murphy. She most likely 
            inherited her musical ability from Homer, also musically inclined.</p>
